# Rust-Book ðŸ¦€

This repository contains my examples with notes while reading the "Rust: The programming language"

## Naming convention

It is possible, that I've skipped certain parts (such as 3.X comments) as they are simple to understand and it's not really worth it.
Also it's possible, that single package contains more chapters as I coded these examples randomly while reading.
